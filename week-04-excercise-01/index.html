    <h1>My Dev Tools Vandalism</h1>

    <p>
      For this exercise, I used my browser’s developer tools to temporarily “vandalize” the Starbucks homepage.
      The changes only appeared on my computer and did not affect the real website.
      Below is a screenshot showing what my modified version looked like.
    </p>

    <div class="screenshot-container">
      <!-- Update this filename to match your actual screenshot -->
      <img src="devtools-vandalism-screenshot.png"
           alt="Screenshot of my modified Starbucks homepage" />
    </div>

    <h2>What I “Vandalized”</h2>

    <p>
      I chose Starbucks.com because the big seasonal promo section makes changes really noticeable.
      Using the Elements panel, I edited the main banner text at the top to say
      <strong>“Surrender Yourself to the Pumpkin Overlords”</strong>. In the large hero section on the right,
      I changed the headline to <strong>“Get your Melted Icecream Today!!”</strong> and the smaller text below to
      repeat “SUGAR SUGAR SUGAR OM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM,” emphasizing how sugary the drinks are.
      I also edited the call-to-action button so it reads
      <strong>“Twice as expensive as one year ago!”</strong>, turning it into a joke about rising prices.
    </p>

    <p>
      These edits were funny to me because they exaggerated what people already think about Starbucks:
      sugary drinks, over-the-top seasonal marketing, and high prices. While experimenting in the Styles panel,
      I adjusted text styling and layout to make sure my changes still looked like they “fit” in the design.
      Overall, this exercise helped me understand how HTML content and CSS styles work together, and how powerful
      dev tools can be for experimenting with layout and debugging my own pages in the future.
